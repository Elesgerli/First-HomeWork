    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions on W3</h1>
    <p>An FAQ list is really a cop-out from managed information. You should be able to find everything you want to know
        by browsing from the WWW project page, as everything should be arranged in a logical way. Here though are things
        which maybe didn't fit into the structure, with pointers to the answers which maybe did. Its an experiment,
        started May 92. The questioners are anonymous.</p>
