    <h1>What is Hypertext</h1>
    Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear.
    <p>
        Hypertext is text which contains
        <a href="Hypertext-folder/Terms.html">Links</a> to other texts. The term was coined by <a href="Hypertext-folder/Xanadu.html">Ted Nelson</a>
        around 1965 (see <a href="Hypertext-folder/History.html">History</a> )
    </p>
    <p>
        HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext which is not constrained to be text: it can include graphics, video and <a href="Hypertext-folder/Talks/YesWeCan.html">Sound</a>
        , for example. Apparently Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too.

    <p>Hypertext and HyperMedia are concepts, not products.</p>
